‚ù§Ô∏èüëâWeather App‚ù§Ô∏è 


*Key Points

-Weather API Integration: Choose a weather API provider such as OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, or any other suitable provider. Sign up for an API key, which you'll use to make requests to the API!

-User Interface (UI): Design the UI for your Weather App. It should include features like a search bar to input city names, a display area to show weather information, and possibly other elements like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc!

-Asynchronous Functionality: Implement asynchronous functions to handle API requests. This ensures that the app remains responsive while waiting for the API responses!
